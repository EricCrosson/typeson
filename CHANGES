# typeson

## Version 4.0.0

- Breaking change: Use object-based structure on `types` (esp. important
    as more possible properties/methods are added, reliance on array
    ordering will become less manageable/intelligible for users).
- Breaking change: Changed default to optimize and avoid replacement
    checks on arrays unless there is at least one type whose spec has
    `testPlainObjects` set. Brings consistency given that non-array
    plain object types must also have the option set to be discoverable.

- Fix: Allow missing recursive array or object member possibilities
- Fix: Cross-frame/Cross-module plain-object
    (including `Object.create(null)`) and array detection
- Fix: Escape keypaths to avoid conflicts when property names
    include dots; fixes #5
- Fix: Nest inside `$` even if object has `$types` that is non-truthy
    or if it has `$types` but no actual types (with tests)
- Fix: Throw if user attempts to define a type with ID "#"
- Fix: Implementation of pojo registration. The sugar:
    `typeson.register({MyClass});` failed if parsing `undefined`
    or `null` since the tester did not check for that.

- Enhancement (Basic API): Avoid needing a replacer (so that it can add
    state config without modifying the object and e.g., set to iterate
    "in" properties; also can be used for validation only)
- Enhancement (Basic API): Allow `fallback` option to `register` to
    assign lower priority to a later registration addition
- Enhancement (Basic API): Support object-based API in addition to
    function/array (with properties, `test`, `replace`, `revive`);
    `this` context is supplied object
- Enhancement (Basic API): Allow per-method-invocation options on
    `encapsulate`/`stringify`/`revive`/`parse`
- Enhancement (Basic API): Support `encapsulateObserver` callback option
    (sending detected `type` when present), adding tests for sync and async

- Enhancement (Types): Allow `encapsulate` to represent primitives and `revive`
    to revive them as such (e.g., to encode a bare `undefined` in the
    same manner as `undefined` properties)
- Enhancement (Types): Allow revival to return instanceof `Typeson.Undefined`
    to indicate restoring to `undefined`
- Enhancement (Types): Add config `testPlainObjects` (which can
    also work with arrays) to allow (non-recursive) tests and replacements
    for plain objects (or arrays)

- Enhancement (async): `stringifyAsync`, `parseAsync`, `encapsulateAsync`,
    `reviveAsync` methods which return promises; have them use `replaceAsync`
    and `reviveAsync` on type specs where relevant
- Enhancement (async): Add `throwOnBadSyncType` option (defaults to `true`)
    which the `*Sync/Async` methods automatically apply
- Enhancement (async): Rather than relying on Promises proper (which could be
    desired as encapsulation results, at least as targets for throwing
    (e.g., Structured Cloning Throwing in `typeson-registry`)), require
    use of a `Typeson.Promise()` (which supports promise methods) to
    indicate a result is to be obtained asynchronously.

- Enhancement (utility): Expose `isObject`, `isPlainObject`,
    `isUserObject`, and `isThenable` as class methods of `Typeson`
- Enhancement (utility): Allow `Typeson.hasConstructorOf` to be tested against
    classes without constructors
- Enhancement (utility): Add `compareConstructors` method for detection of
    instances like `Intl.Collator` whose `toStringTag` is
    indistinguishable from other classes; document
- Enhancement (utility): Add `Typeson.toStringTag` class method given frequent
    need by types
- Enhancement (utility): Add `escapeKeyPathComponent`,
    `unescapeKeyPathComponent`, and `getByKeyPath` as class methods of
    `Typeson`

- Enhancement (key iteration): Allow setting of `iterateIn` state
    ('object' or 'array') by type methods to give purely modular control
    and ensure iteration on prototype only occurs when set by the type
    (e.g., so not iterating iterating all objects unless detected as such);
    `iterateIn` defaults to not being set.
- Enhancement (key iteration): Allow setting of `iterateUnsetNumeric`
    boolean state object property to give purely modular control
    and ensure iteration of unset (sparse) numeric array indexes only
    occurs when set by the type (e.g., so not iterating iterating all arrays
    unless detected as such); defaults to `false`

- Testing (fix): Prevent `ArrayBuffer` detection clashing with other types
- Testing bugs: Add test for current behavior of replacer
    (tester/encapsulator) ordering
- Testing bugs: Keypaths with property names including dots
- Testing bugs: Test for clashes with objects using own `$` and `$types`
    properties
- Testing bugs: Ensure preventing types with ID "#"
- Testing features: Add encapsulate observer tests
- Testing features: Add `toJSON` tests
- Testing features: Add `Typeson.Promise` `all`/`race` tests
- Testing features: Support promise-based tests

- Docs (README): Document new features
- Docs (README): Describe more of the resulting encapsulated structure
- Docs (README): Document recursive nature of replacements (and promises)
- Docs (README): Indicate sequence upon subsequent `register` calls
- Docs (README): Indicate precedence of testing/encapsulating when an
    array is supplied
- Docs (README): Indicate support for arrays and primitives at root by
    return of new object
- Docs (README): summarize properties and specify types consistently in headers
- Docs (README): Use backticks to set off code references
- Docs (README): Improve headings hierarchy, more descriptions and
    documentation of async/sync methods

- npm: Update dev dependencies

## Version 3.2.0

- Enhancement: Allow reviver to set the explicit value `undefined` (by
    returning an instance of `Typeson.Undefined`)
- Enhancement: Pass in state objects to tests and replacers so that
    they can vary their results depending on setting (currently only
    whether we are iterating an "own" key property or not)
- Refactoring: Remove redundant nullish-check
- Clean-up: Remove trailing WS, consistent semi-colon usage
- Docs: Consistent and best practices heading hierarchy in README
- Docs: Mention use of tester for throwing exceptions
- Docs: Add docs for `stateObj`
- Docs: Add docs for `undefined` behavior in encapsulators and revivers,
    the use of `Typeson.Undefined` to explicitly add `undefined`
